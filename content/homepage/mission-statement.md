In a fast paced world focused on success and achievement, we often undervalue the importance of connection in everyday interactions. The work of educating our children is often outsourced, creating a disconnect in the way parents understand what drives their child to learn. This disconnect makes dealing with problematic behaviors difficult. I believe that through such **connections** and attention to the **child’s environment**, parents are the key to long lasting behavior change in their child. It is for this reason that I want to help you step away from what is not working and find a new groove in your parenting. Through behavioral counseling, I want to help you and your child re-establish a balanced and meaningful relationship with the goal of addressing behaviors that cause dysregulation within your family. Using the science of Applied Behavior Analysis, I want to help you be the change agent and create the best suited environment for your child’s development; one that is individualized to them and to how they learn. Let’s work together and watch them flourish!
