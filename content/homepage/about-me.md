##### Laura Kliger, BCBA, MADS

Hello. I am a [Board Certified Behavior Analyst](https://www.bacb.com) with an insatiable passion for child development and self-directed learning. I have been working in many settings (homes, schools, clinics and in the community) with children of all ages. I have been supporting parents, teachers, and therapists to better understand and manage behaviors. My passion is to help parents reclaim their role; to understand their childâ€™s behavior and to make changes that allow the family to live in a more cohesive and symbiotic way.

In 2009, I started working with preschool aged children and found myself drawn to those with Autism and other neurodivergent traits. I pursued this interest straight into a career in Applied Behavior Analysis. While I love working directly with children and after becoming a parent myself, I became steadfast in my conviction that the most meaningful and long lasting behavior change comes from the safety and connectivity of child-parent relationships. This shifted my focus to wanting to help parents learn to enact change in their own children. As my children grew, I also started questioning contemporary education as a whole, and have integrated the abundance of research on the benefits of self-directed learning and intrinsic motivation to my practice of behavior change. While at first this research seemed to contradict some of the work I had been doing, I quickly realized that it was the field of ABA, not the science, that had been shaped to accommodate our education system. I want to help you integrate the benefits of self-directed learning using the science of Applied Behavior Analysis to help your child thrive.
